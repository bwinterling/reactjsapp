# reactjsapp
Just messing around with React

## build
Uses webpack to build the dist: `npm run webpack`

## running tests
Tests have not been set up yet.  Once you do, add a script to the package.json file, for example:

```
"test": "ava 'app/**/*.test.js' --verbose --require ./other/setup-ava-tests.js"
```

Then run the tests by typing `npm run test`
